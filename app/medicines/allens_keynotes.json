Itoccurs in the form of crystals with a mother-of - pearl luster, and is fatty tothe touch. It is soluble in both alcohol and ether.Ameke claimed to have derived great advantage from its use in casesdiagnosed as cancer of the liver, or in such obstinate engorgements thatmalignancy was suspected.Burnett claims to have twice cured cancer of the liver with it, and “inhepatic engorgements that by reason of their intractable and slow yielding towell-selected remedies make one think interrogationally of cancer.” In suchconditions where the diagnosis is in doubt, especially if the patient has beensubjected to repeated attacks of biliary colic, Cholesterinum, he claims, isvery satisfactory and at times its action even striking.",
